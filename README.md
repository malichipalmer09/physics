## Game-physics-engine_development
Development of game physics engine using C++ with the help of [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1501484.Game_Physics_Engine_Development_With_CDROM_) book by Ian Millington.

## Inspiration and Motivation:
* Of cource excited with physics engines and want to know how they work.
* About the book Game Physics Engine Development by Ian Millington on [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123694713/game-physics-engine-development).
    > Game Physics Engine Development carefully describes each step in the creation of a robust, usable physics engine. It introduces the mathematical concepts in a clear and simple manner, keeping to high school level topics and building a physics code library as it goes. Each new concept is explained in diagrams and code to make sure that even the most novice of game programmers understands. This book will serve as a introduction to more mathematically advanced books on game physics.

## A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).
And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

### [Noteworthy open source libraries for visual computing](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/Visual-Computing-Markerless-Motion-Pose-Face-detection-tracking-and-3D-reconstruction#noteworthy-open-source-libraries-for-visual-computing).

## Getting started:
* Get started with [Raylib](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-developing-graphical-application-or-game-engine-with-raylib-has-very-good-c-bindings-as-base-library), which is a foundation library to build your own graphical application or game engine itself. Or, more well maintained and commercial grade C++ engine [G3D](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-developing-any-graphical-application-with-the-g3d-).
* You guessed it,
* Start and finish with [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1501484.Game_Physics_Engine_Development_With_CDROM_) book by Ian Millington.
* [Accompanying source code for this book on github](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).

### Have Fun!!!
