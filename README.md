## Game-physics-engine_development
Development of game physics engine using C++ with the help of [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1501484.Game_Physics_Engine_Development_With_CDROM_) book by Ian Millington.

## Inspiration and Motivation:
* Of cource excited with physics engines and want to know how they work.
* About the book Game Physics Engine Development by Ian Millington on [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123694713/game-physics-engine-development).
    > Game Physics Engine Development carefully describes each step in the creation of a robust, usable physics engine. It introduces the mathematical concepts in a clear and simple manner, keeping to high school level topics and building a physics code library as it goes. Each new concept is explained in diagrams and code to make sure that even the most novice of game programmers understands. This book will serve as a introduction to more mathematically advanced books on game physics.

## Getting started:
* You guessed it,
* Start and finish with [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1501484.Game_Physics_Engine_Development_With_CDROM_) book by Ian Millington.
